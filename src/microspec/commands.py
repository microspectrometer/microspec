"""Send commands to the dev-kit.

Example
-------

>>> import microspec
>>> kit = microspec.Devkit()

If ``status=='ERROR'`` it means the command or its arguments are
invalid.

TODO(sustainablelab): after receiving an ERROR, flush
serial communication. The flush involves a short timeout (I can't
think of a better way without implementing packets). This is
a serial-flush-timeout is intentional. It is NOT the general
timeout case I cover next.

If ``status=='TIMEOUT'`` it means the command timed out before a
response was received.

For applications that run a long time, such as data loggers and
free-running plot GUIs, there are occasional timeouts when
calling :func:`~micropsec.commands.Devkit.captureFrame`. These
applications should check the
:class:`~micropsec.replies.captureFrame_response.status`
attribute of responses to
:func:`~micropsec.commands.Devkit.captureFrame` and ignore the
data if the status is 'TIMEOUT'.

A ``UserWarning`` is also issued when a timeout occurs,
identifying which command timed out. This is not an exception, so
it does not cause the application to terminate.

Notes
-----
The :class:`~microspec.commands.Devkit` attribute ``timeout``
defaults to 2 seconds, which is usually long enough to send a
command, execute it on the dev-kit, and receive a response back
on the host computer running the application. It is rare to
observe a timeout when sending commands at the REPL or executing
a script that runs a few commands and exits. Users can observe
a timeout condition by setting a very short timeout such as 1ms.

    Notes
    -----

    :mod:`microspeclib` uses ``struct.pack()` to translate the
    command and its arguments into a byte sequence to send over
    serial.

    See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.pack

    ``struct.pack()`` takes a "format" argument.

    See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#format-characters

    :mod:`microspeclib` uses formats "B", "H", and "L".
    These are unsigned integers, sized 1, 2, and 4 bytes
    respectively.

    Negative parameter values, therefore, are not allowed. But
    :mod:`microspeclib` does not check for negative values. If a
    user passes negative parameter values, the ``struct``
    package's built-in exceptions show-up in the traceback.

    At the level of application development with ``microspec``,
    it is not immediately obvious that the problem is due to
    using a negative value.
    
    ``microspec`` deals with this by checking for negative
    parameter values in :class:`Devkit`.

    Note: the dev-kit firmware already rejects out-of-range
    values with an ERROR status, but it cannot reject a value if
    the application exits due to an exception, and it needs to be
    clear to the user what the cause of the exception is.

    :mod:`microspeclib` provides a user-configurable timeout. The

        num_pixels : int
            The number of pixels in the frame (either 392 or 784
            depending on pixel binning).
        pixels : list
            The 16-bit ADC counts at each pixel, starting with pixel 1
            and ending with pixel 392 or 784 (depending on pixel
            binning).
        frame : dict
            Python dictionary where the key is the pixel number and
            the value is the 16-bit ADC counts at that pixel.

        Examples
        --------

        *Setup*:

        >>> import microspec as usp
        >>> kit = usp.Devkit()

        Capture a frame:

        >>> reply = kit.captureFrame()

        The frame is stored as a Python ``list`` of numbers. Each
        number is the signal strength at that pixel in units of
        *counts*.

        The list starts with pixel 1. With pixel binning on, the
        frame has 392 pixels, so the list ends with pixel 392:

        >>> print(reply)
        captureFrame_response(status='OK', num_pixels=392,
                              pixels=[...], frame={...})

        The list ``pixels`` is hard to read on its own (index 0
        is pixel 1, index 1 is pixel 2, etc.):

        >>> print(reply.pixels)
        [..., ..., ...]

        It is usually more convenient for applications to use the
        dict ``frame`` because it tags each pixel with its pixel
        number:

        >>> print(reply.frame)
        {1: ..., 2: ..., ..., 391: ..., 392: ...}

        This is still hard to read in the REPL. Put each pixel on
        its own line:

        >>> import pprint
        >>> pprint.pprint(reply.frame)
        {1: ...,
         2: ...,
         ...
         391: ...,
         392: ...}

        Alternatively, turn the ``(pixel number, pixel value)``
        pairs into a list of ``tuples``:

        >>> frame = list(zip(range(1,reply.num_pixels+1), reply.pixels))
        >>> pprint.pprint(frame)
        [(1, ...),
         (2, ...),
         ...,
         (391, ...),
         (392,...)]

        Notes
        -----
        If there is a timeout, :func:`captureFrame` returns
        ``status='TIMEOUT'``, and fills the reply with obviously
        bad data:

            - ``num_pixels=0``
            - ``pixels=[]``
            - ``frame={}``

        Applications are protected from accidentally setting a
        :attr:`Devkit.timeout` that is shorter than the exposure
        time (because this *guarantees* that :func:`captureFrame`
        timeouts before a response is received).

        If the timeout is less than the exposure time,
        :func:`captureFrame` uses a :attr:`Devkit.timeout` that
        is one second longer than the exposure time.

        If an application loops :func:`captureFrame` for a long
        time (such as the data logging and plotting GUI examples
        above), there will likely be a timeout.

        In this case, :func:`captureFrame` issues a
        ``UserWarning`` describing which command caused the
        timeout.

            This is only a warning because the timeout is
            hardware-dependent. It does **not** indicate a bug in
            the application code.

        The timeout ``UserWarning`` prints to the console and can
        safely be ignored. If the timeouts are a frequent event,
        it indicates a problem with the host computer, its USB
        port, or the USB cable.

        """Write a new autoexpose configuration to the dev-kit.

        This updates autoexpose attrs using the input arguments.

        These are the autoexpose attrs:

            - ``autoexpose_max_tries``
            - ``autoexpose_start_pixel``
            - ``autoexpose_stop_pixel``
            - ``autoexpose_target``
            - ``autoexpose_target_tolerance``
            - ``autoexpose_max_exposure``

        If you want to be certain the autoexpose attrs are synced
        with the dev-kit, follow this with a
        ``getAutoExposeConfig()`` call.

        Examples
        --------

        *Setup*:

        >>> import microspec as usp
        >>> kit = usp.Devkit()

        Configure auto-expose with the default parameters...:

        >>> kit.setAutoExposeConfig()
        setAutoExposeConfig_response(status='OK')

        See what the new auto-expose parameters are:

        >>> kit.getAutoExposeConfig()
        getAutoExposeConfig_response(status='OK', max_tries=12,
                                    start_pixel=7, stop_pixel=392,

        # FIRMWARE BUG:
        # ``max_exposure`` is sometimes written with 4112 instead of
        # whatever value (specified or default) is passed with the
        # command.
        #
        # This is a firmware bug. Don't know why it happens.
        #
        # The bug is repeatable:
        # Call setAutoExposeConfig followed by getAutoExposeConfig about
        # four or five times. Initially they all work as expected, then
        # they start alternating:
        # every other time setAutoExposeConfig is called, the
        # max_exposure gets set to 4112:
        # >>> kit.setAutoExposeConfig(); reply1 = kit.getAutoExposeConfig();
        # ... kit.setAutoExposeConfig(); reply2 = kit.getAutoExposeConfig();
        # ... print(f"{reply1.max_exposure}, {reply2.max_exposure}")
        # 10000, 4112
        #
        # TEMPORARY FIX:
        # Check if max_exposure if 4112. If so, just setAutoExposeConfig
        # again. I have not observed 4112 written consecutively.
        # Test that this fix is good enough:

        # ...    reply = kit.getAutoExposeConfig()
