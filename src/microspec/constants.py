"""Names for common constants used by the API.

Example
-------

>>> import microspec as usp
>>> usp.GREEN
1

See the complete :ref:`list-of-constants`.

View the :ref:`test_constants-source` for examples using
constants.

Use constants instead of hard-coded numbers
-------------------------------------------

Calls using these constants should refer to them by the names
defined here instead of hard-coding the values in application
code. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    kit.setBridgeLED(led_setting=usp.GREEN) # <-- Do this.
    kit.setBridgeLED(led_setting=1)         # <-- NOT this!

Constants in microspec match microspeclib
-----------------------------------------

List constants in microspeclib:

>>> import microspeclib.datatypes.types as dtypes
>>> dtypes.__all__
['StatusOK', 'StatusError', ...]

These constants are defined in the ``globals`` object in the
:ref:`JSON API config file <dev-kit-API-JSON>`.

Example
^^^^^^^

microspec ``OK`` equals microspeclib ``StatusOK``:

>>> usp.OK == dtypes.StatusOK
True

The tests in
:class:`microspec.tests.test_constants.TestConsistent_with_microspeclib`
checks if the constants in the API are consistent with the JSON
config file.

"""int: The dev-kit successfully executed the command.

``status=='OK'`` most of the time. Application code *usually*
does not check ``status`` because the :mod:`~microspec.commands`
check ``status`` internally and issue a warning or raise an
exception if ``status`` is not :data:`~microspec.constants.OK`.

Applications *should* check ``status`` if receiving
a ``UserWarning`` that the command timed out. Specific
:mod:`~microspec.commands` and :mod:`~microspec.replies` discuss
application use cases where ``status=='TIMEOUT'`` is known to
occur and how to handle such cases.

ERROR
"""
ERROR = _constants['StatusError']
"""int: The dev-kit failed to execute the command.

``status=='ERROR'`` indicates that serial communication
succeeded, but the dev-kit firmware did not understand the
command or its parameters. If ``status=='ERROR'``, the other
response attributes are not valid. For example, if reading
exposure time and ``status=='ERROR'``, the exposure time values
are meaningless.

Application code (code using the API) **does not need to check
for** ``status=='ERROR'``: it does not occur when using the API.

When testing commands at the REPL, ``status=='ERROR'`` is useful
for identifying invalid command parameters. For example, ``42``
is invalid for ``led_num`` in ``getBridgeLED(led_num=42)``.

There are two other possible reasons for ``status=='ERROR'``, but
these cannot be replicated at the REPL when using the
``microspec`` API:

    - the command ID itself is invalid
    - the host computer sent a valid command ID and valid
      parameter values, but the bytes were corrupted (in a way
      that did not cause serial communication to fail)

In either of those cases, microspec flushes serial communication
by sending several null commands and clearing the resulting
garbage data from the read buffer by reading values from the
buffer until a short timeout elapses.
