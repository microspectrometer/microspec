__doc__ = """Automated and static docstrings for json-generated classes, functions, and globals

Most of the API objects in MicroSpecLib are dynamically generated from cfg/microspec.json.
For example CommandSetBridgeLED, MicroSpecSimpleInterface.setBridgeLED, and LEDGreen are not
defined in code, they are created by meta-class factories, so that if the configuration changes
to permit new protocol commands and replies, the functions and classes will automatically update
as well. However, this causes a problem for documentation. 

Great pains were taken to auto-generate the proper function and class signatures such as
CommandSetBridgeLED(led_num=None, led_setting=None) rather than just CommandSetBridgeLED(\*args,
\**kwargs), so that pydoc and sphinx could introspect and document them properly. However,
the ONE thing that cannot be auto-generated is the per-function and per-class human-read
documentation. It could go into yet another json file and be auto-generated, but that would
be no more compact than making a file elsewhere for it. It could be written directly in
sphinx doc/source/\*.rst files, but then pydoc wouldn't find them. So the only choice left
is to make a separate internals docstrings library with the data in one place there, and
that is what this module is. Luckily, it at least saves some repetition, since both
CommandSetBridgeLED and MicroSpecSimpleInterface.setBridgeLED need the same documentation,
for example.

Thus, this module contains dictionaries for the different data and class types, and the datatype
module imports and implements them when it instantiates the metaclasses and generates the
globals. Since the json protocol and the documentation are separate, we must assume that one might
get out of sync with the other, thus it is assumed that this documentation may be missing
something. As such, implementers of these dictionaries should use DOC.get(value, None) and
handle lack of documentation in a responsible way.

The CHROMASPEC_DYNAMIC_DOC["command"]["CommandGetBridgeLED"] contains that docstring, for example.

And the _common global is used to hold common replacement patterns, to eliminate having to type
the same things over and over below - they are replaced at the end of the module.

Parameters
----------
max_tries: 1-255
  Maximum number of exposures to try before giving up.

  Firmware defaults to 10 on power-up.

  If max_tries is 0, status is ERROR and the AutoExposeConfig is
  not changed.

start_pixel: 7-392 if binning on, 14-784 if binning off
  Auto-expose ignores pixels below start_pixel when checking if
  the peak is in the target range.

  Firmware defaults to 7 on power-up.
  Recommended value is the smallest pixel number in the
  pixel-to-wavelength map.

  If start_pixel is outside the allowed range, status is ERROR
  and the AutoExposeConfig is not changed.

stop_pixel: 7-392 if binning on, 14-784 if binning off, must be >= start_pixel
  Auto-expose ignores pixels above stop_pixel when checking if
  the peak is in the target range.

  Firmware defaults to 392 on power-up.
  Recommended value is the largest pixel number in the
  pixel-to-wavelength map.

  If stop_pixel < start_pixel, or if stop_pixel is outside the
  allowed range, status is ERROR and the AutoExposeConfig is not
  changed.

target: 4500-65535
  Target peak-counts for exposure gain calculation.

  Firmware defaults to 46420 counts on power-up.

  If target is outside the allowed range, status is ERROR and the
  AutoExposeConfig is not changed.

target_tolerance: 0-65535
  target +/- target_tolerance is the target peak-counts range.
  Auto-expose is finished when the peak counts lands in this
  range.

  Firmware defaults to 3277 counts on power-up.

  If the combination of target and target_tolerance results in
  target ranges extending below 4500 counts or above 65535
